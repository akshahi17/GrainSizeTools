[GrainSizeTools](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00863) is a free, open-source, cross-platform script written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) that provides several tools for (1) Describing and visualizing grain size populations, (2) estimating differential stress for different mineral phases via paleopizometers and (3) apply stereology methods to approximate the actual distribution (3D) of grain size from sections. The script **does not require previous experience with Python programming language** (see documentation below and [FAQ](https://github.com/marcoalopez/GrainSizeTools/blob/master/DOCS/FAQ.md)). For users with coding skills, the script is organized in a modular (functional) way facilitating the reuse and code extension.

**Latest release: v3.0.2**  
**Date: 2020/12/31**  
See: https://github.com/marcoalopez/GrainSizeTools/releases/tag/v3.0.2

> **Important note**: The script has been completely reorganized in v3+, including new modules and features. **Its use is no longer compatible with previous versions (v2.x).** Check the new documentation for use.


## Features at a glance

- Import and manipulate tabular-like datasets including txt, csv, or excel formats.

- Full automatic descriptive statistics of grain size populations including:

  - Several averages (arithmetic and geometric means, median, and frequency peak ("mode") via Gaussian Kernel Density Estimator)
  - Estimation of robust confidence intervals (including some specific methods for lognormal populations such as the modified Cox or the GCI method)
  - Measures of dispersion and shape of the population
  - Normality and lognormality test

- Estimate differential stress using paleopiezometers. It includes multiple piezometric relations for quartz, olivine, calcite, and feldspar (others planned!)

- Ready-to-publish plots in bitmap or vector format (see screenshots below), including:

  - Histograms and kernel density estimates
  - Area- or volume-weighted plots
  - Normalized plots
  - Quantile-quantile plots, and more

- Stereology methods (approximate the actual 3D grain size distribution from data collected in plane sections):

  - Saltykov method
  - Two-step method (lognormal fitting, shape characterization)
